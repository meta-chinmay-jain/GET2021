# Linked List
## Assignment 1 - Overview of Data Structures

### <u>**Question 1**</u>

A sub list is a part of list within a given window of positions named L and R, where L is the left position in list and R is the right position. Implement a linked list and write a method to rotate sub list in clockwise direction by the number of steps (N) given as input. For Example:
> Given Linked list is 2->3->4->5->6->7 and L=2, R=5 and N=2 <br>
Sublist is 3->4->5->6 <br>
Rotating the sublinklist 3->4->5->6 with N=2 the result would be 5->6->3->4 <br>
So, our new linked list is 2->5->6->3->4->7

As an output display the modified linked list.

### <u>**Question 2**</u>

Write a method to detect loop in linked list.

### <u>**Question 3**</u>

Can you visualise the representation of a multivariate polynomial using a nested list? <br>
Provide a function to find the degree of a multivariate polynomial. <br>
E.g. In this polynomial 3x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>4</sup> - 5z<sup>2</sup> + x - y + 20, the degree is 2+4 = 6.
